# Undergraduate Research Program (URP)
---
Mostly run by graudate students for undergraduate students.

## Program schedule (repeated every year)

| Spring (1st)    | Summer                   | Fall (2nd)              | Winter                               |
| ---             | ---                      | ---                     | ---                                  |
| CPU             | ECC <br> PCIe <br> C++   | DRAM <br> GP-GPU        | DRAM Controller <br> + SystemVerilog |

## Recommendations
Below are ideal schedules for students who want to enter the graduate program or the industry. The PI does not expect students to enroll all the programs.
